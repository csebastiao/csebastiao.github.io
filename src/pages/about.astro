          <p class="text-justify">Born in France, I am doing my PhD now in Copenhagen. Before that, in my previous

            I worked in several other places in France (Marseille, Lyon, Grenoble, and BesanÃ§on) and in Turin.

          <p class="text-justify">On my free time, I mostly play video games and read books (essays and literature),
            and I am always looking to expand the neverending list of recommendations for both.

          <p class="text-justify">I wanted to do research as a child when I discovered that you can be paid to 
            learn, discover, and share that with others. I still have that childish wonder, but now I also believe
            that I can also support societal changes through my work. I am standing on the shoulder of giants,
            not only scientific ones but also the ones from everyone who gave me the privileges to do that job.
